# Car Damage Detection API

This repository contains a machine learning-based API for detecting car damage from images. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using Docker. The API is production-ready and includes monitoring and logging features.

---

## Features
- **Preprocessing**: Prepares training and validation datasets.
- **Model Training**: Trains a binary classifier using transfer learning with ResNet50.
- **Model Evaluation**: Provides metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **REST API**: Exposes an endpoint for predictions (`/predict`) and a health check (`/health`).
- **Containerization**: Dockerized for easy deployment.
- **Monitoring**: Integrated with Prometheus for metrics and Flask logging for tracking.
- **CI/CD**: Automated build and push using GitHub Actions.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/car-damage-detection.git ## update repo name as required.
cd threev_test
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Set up a Python environment and install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Pipeline Locally
To preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate it:
```bash
python src/preprocess.py
python src/train.py
python src/evaluate.py
```

### 4. Run the API Locally
Run the Flask application:
```bash
python app.py
```
Access the API:
- **Health Check**: `http://localhost:5000/health`
- **Prediction**: `http://localhost:5000/predict` (POST an image as `file`).

### 5. Containerization with Docker
Build and run the Docker container:
```bash
docker build -t car-damage-api .
docker run -p 5000:5000 car-damage-api
```

Test the API running in Docker:
```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@path_to_image.jpg" http://localhost:5000/predict
```

---

## CI/CD Pipeline
This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow to build and push the Docker image to DockerHub automatically.

### Set Up Secrets
1. Add `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` as GitHub secrets.

### Trigger Pipeline
Push to the `main` branch to trigger the CI/CD workflow.

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Logs
- The API uses Python's built-in logging to capture all events.
- Logs are printed to the console and can be forwarded to monitoring tools like AWS CloudWatch.

### Metrics
- Prometheus metrics are exposed at `/metrics`.
- Key metrics include:
  - **Request Count**: Total number of API requests.
  - **Latency**: Time taken to process each prediction.
  - **Prediction Confidence**: Confidence score of predictions.

### Prometheus and Grafana Integration
- Use Prometheus to scrape metrics from `/metrics`.
- Visualize metrics using Grafana by connecting it to Prometheus.

## Endpoints
| Endpoint       | Method | Description                                    |
|----------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| `/health`      | `GET`  | Health check to ensure the API is running.     |
| `/predict`     | `POST` | Accepts an image and returns prediction result.|
| `/metrics`     | `GET`  | Exposes metrics for monitoring (Prometheus).   |

---

## Examples

### Prediction Request (cURL)
```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@path_to_image.jpg" http://localhost:5000/predict
```

Response:
```json
{
    "result": "damaged",
    "probability": 0.823,
    "latency": 0.34
}
```

---

## Airflow Integration
- Airflow DAGs are defined in the `pipelines/` directory.
- The DAG orchestrates the preprocessing, training, and evaluation of the model.

airflow db init
airflow users create --username admin --firstname Admin --lastname User --role Admin --email admin@example.com --password admin
airflow webserver --port 8080
airflow scheduler

Airflow UI: http://localhost:8080
and we can trigger the DAG pipeline using train_pipeline.py with command:
airflow dags trigger train_pipeline


## Future Improvements
- Add support for cloud-based deployments (AWS, GCP, Azure).
- Implement automated model re-training with new data.
- Use MLFlow for experiment tracking and model versioning.
